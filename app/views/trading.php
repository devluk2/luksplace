<h3>Trading rules</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Set a maximum loss amount or percentage for the day. For example: €100 or 5%-10% of the account. Never exceed that amount to avoid overtrading. If you reach your limit, take a deep breath, turn off your computer, and come back to trading the next day. Make this a hard rule; otherwise, you're going to blow your account.</li>
    <li>Split the said amount into a maximum of four losing trades per day (stop loss at €25 or 2%-4% risk per trade).</li>
    <li>Use whatever strategy you prefer.</li>
</ol>
